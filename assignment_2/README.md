USAGE

In the google drive you will find 2 videos: one is to correctly download and setup our packages (setup.mkv), and the other
one is to show the execution of our code (execution.mkv). Here is a summary of the operations: First of all download the
entire Bitbucket repository as slight changes have been made within the package of the first assignment (in our repository
the controller package). You will need two terminal windows to launch our simulation. To launch the simulation you will
need the following instructions:

EXAMPLE

- place the two packages in the src folder
- move into your workspace (e.g catkin\_ws) 
- on your terminal: source devel/setup.bash
- catkin build
- open another terminal
- on the second terminal: source devel/setup.bash
- on cmd1: roslaunch assignment\_2 as2.launch
- on cmd2 (after Tiago closed its arm): roslaunch assignment\_2 nodes.launch
